      "longSummary": "One paragraph summaries\n\nSylvia Berryman argues that John Philoponus's 6th-century attempt to reconcile Aristotelian natural philosophy with post-Euclidean geometrical optics ultimately failed, but this failure reveals a significant defensive strategy used in late antiquity to preserve the relationship between mathematical sciences and natural philosophy. She demonstrates this through a detailed examination of how Philoponus tried to equate the geometrical concept of visual rays with Aristotle's theory of color actualities affecting a transparent medium, showing that this reconciliation breaks down on two critical points: first, incorporeal actualities present throughout a medium cannot account for the cone-shaped visual field and precise geometry of perspective required by Euclidean optics; and second, explaining the physics of deflection in mirrors requires treating them as receiving and retransmitting effects, which undermines Aristotle's claim that mirror images are observer-dependent and introduces localization problems inconsistent with actualities being present everywhere in the medium. The broader significance, Berryman contends, lies in how commentators responded to this incompatibility by asserting that \"it makes no difference\" which physical theory of vision one adopts—mathematical optics works independently—a strategy explicitly paralleled with \"saving the appearances\" in astronomy that reflects how all four Aristotelian \"intermediate sciences\" were flourishing by avoiding natural philosophical questions, creating tensions that would eventually contribute to the emergence of unified mathematical physics in the 17th century.\n\nIn her article, Sylvia Berryman's main conclusion is that the attempt by the 6th-century CE commentator John Philoponus to reconcile Aristotle's theory of vision with the more advanced geometrical optics of his time was ultimately unsuccessful. Berryman argues that this failure was due to two major challenges posed by later optical theories: the geometry of perspective and the physics of deflection. While Philoponus tried to equate the energeiai (actualities) of Aristotle's account with the opseis (visual rays) of geometrical optics, he could not adequately explain how immaterial actualities could account for the cone-shaped visual field needed to judge perspective and size, nor could he explain how they could be deflected by mirrors without undermining Aristotle's core ideas. A larger theme identified by Berryman is that commentators like Philoponus adopted an \"insulation strategy,\" claiming \"it makes no difference\" (ouden diaphôrei) which physical theory of vision was used, thereby asserting the independence of mathematical sciences like optics from natural philosophy in an attempt to manage the growing conflicts between them.\n\nLLM summary #1\n\nMain Argument\nSylvia Berryman examines how 6th-century CE Aristotelian commentators, particularly John Philoponus, attempted to reconcile Aristotle's theory of vision with post-Euclidean geometrical optics. She argues this reconciliation ultimately failed, but reveals an important defensive strategy: claiming that mathematical models in \"intermediate sciences\" (like optics) are independent from physical theories of vision.\n\nKey Points\nThe Compatibility Problem:\nAristotle's Meteorology uses optical geometry with an opsis (line of sight) that deflects from mirrors\nHis De Anima presents a different theory: vision occurs when colored objects actualize the transparent medium, affecting the eye\nPost-Aristotelian Euclidean optics introduced a cone of multiple visual rays diverging from the eye—incompatible with both accounts\nPhiloponus's Failed Solution:\nHe claimed mathematical optics works regardless of whether visual effects go from the eye or to the eye (\"it makes no difference\")\nHe tried treating energeiai (actualities in the medium) as equivalents to visual rays\nThis failed because:\nIncorporeal actualities can't explain the cone-shaped visual field or perspective geometry\nDeflection requires physical explanation—mirrors must receive and retransmit effects, contradicting Aristotle's view\nThe account can't explain localization and directionality of vision\nThe \"Insulation Strategy\":\nCommentators used the phrase \"it makes no difference\" (ouden diaphôrei) programmatically—far beyond Aristotle's limited use\nThis paralleled astronomy's \"saving the appearances\"—keeping mathematical models separate from physical explanations\nReflected broader tensions between all four Aristotelian \"intermediate sciences\" (optics, astronomy, harmonics, mechanics) and natural philosophy in late antiquity\n\nSignificance\nThe paper shows how mathematical sciences were flourishing independently while natural philosophy struggled to accommodate them—a dynamic crucial for understanding the eventual emergence of mathematized physics in the 17th century.\n\nLLM summary #2\n\nBerryman argues that late-antique Aristotelians—especially John Philoponus—tried and failed to reconcile Aristotle’s natural philosophy of vision with the post-Euclidean, geometrical optics of lines, cones, and mirror/refraction phenomena. Aristotle had classified optics as an “intermediate science” that studies mathematical relations in nature without full causal theory; his Meteorology explains appearances (rainbows, halos) via an opsis (line of sight) and deflection, but it sits uneasily with the causal account of vision in De Anima. Philoponus’ strategy is to reinterpret the geometers’ “visual rays” as Aristotelian energeiai (actualities) that are present throughout the medium and have direction of influence without any “travel.” He uses this to claim that, for the geometry, “it makes no difference” whether something goes out from the eye or comes from the object. Berryman shows this move breaks down on two fronts: (1) the geometry of perspective (the cone of vision and judgments of apparent size/distance) requires localized, converging structure that the “everywhere-present” actualities struggle to supply; and (2) the physics of deflection (especially mirrors and burning-glasses) forces Philoponus to treat mirrors as receiving and then re-emitting actualities—effectively making them sources—undermining Aristotle’s own view that mirror images are just “seeing by deflection.” She situates this within a wider late-antique “insulation strategy”: commentators generalize the slogan “it makes no difference” (paired with astronomy’s “saving the appearances”) to protect the mathematical success of the intermediate sciences (optics, astronomy, harmonics, mechanics) from conflicts with Aristotelian physics. The accumulating tensions, she suggests, prefigure the early-modern unification of mathematics and physics. \n\nLLM summary #3\n\nSylvia Berryman's article examines the attempts by Aristotelian commentators in late antiquity, particularly John Philoponus in the 6th century CE, to reconcile Aristotle's theory of vision with the more advanced geometrical optics that developed in the centuries after him. The article argues that Philoponus's integration of these two fields was ultimately unsuccessful because Aristotle's account is seriously challenged by newer theories on the geometry of perspective and the physics of deflection.\n\nA larger theme of the article is the identification of a strategy used in late antiquity to insulate mathematical sciences like optics from conflicts with natural philosophy. Commentators claimed \"it makes no difference\" (ouden diaphôrei) which physical theory of vision was adopted for the purposes of geometrical optics. This approach is explicitly compared to the idea of \"saving the appearances\" in astronomy and is crucial for understanding the changing relationship between the \"intermediate sciences\" and natural philosophy.\n\nThe Initial Problem: Reconciling Aristotle's Own Texts\nAristotle classified optics as one of four \"intermediate sciences\" between mathematics and natural philosophy. These disciplines study the mathematical relationships in the natural world without offering complete physical explanations. For example, in his Meteorology, Aristotle uses ideas from optics to explain phenomena like rainbows and haloes, focusing on the geometry of how things appear to us rather than the physical nature of vision itself.\n\nThis focus on geometry involves the concept of opsis, a term that could mean the eye, sight, a visual process, or a \"visual ray\" emanating from the eye. The Meteorology describes opsis as something that can be deflected from surfaces, which has physical implications (e.g., it \"stretches out\" and \"weakens\" over distance). This creates a potential conflict with Aristotle's primary theory of vision in De Anima, which does not involve a ray traveling from the eye. In De Anima, color is said to change the transparent medium, and this change then affects the sense organ.\n\nPhiloponus's Attempt at Reconciliation\nCenturies later, commentators like Philoponus faced an even more complex task. Geometrical optics had adopted the Euclidean model, which posits multiple opseis (visual rays) diverging from the eye in a cone-shaped array to explain perspective—why objects appear smaller from farther away. This was a significant departure from the single opsis model in Aristotle's Meteorology.\n\nPhiloponus attempted to bridge this gap by equating the opseis of geometrical optics with the energeiai ('activities' or 'actualities') from Aristotle's De Anima. His key claim was that it makes no difference to the geometry whether lines are drawn proceeding from the eye to a mirror (the optics model) or deflected from the mirror to the eye (the Aristotelian model). Philoponus argued for a \"static\" conception of these energeiai, suggesting they are incorporeal states or \"actualities\" present throughout the medium as a whole, rather than physical things that travel. Vision occurs when an observer's eye is correctly oriented along a straight line with the object.\n\nThe Failure of Reconciliation\nBerryman argues that Philoponus's reconciliation fails due to two major difficulties: the geometry of perspective and the physics of deflection.\nGeometry of Perspective: The Euclidean model's power lies in its use of a visual cone to explain how we judge an object's size based on the angle it subtends at the eye. For Philoponus's theory to work, the energeiai coming froman object would need to converge at every possible point from which an eye can see it, while still conveying the necessary information about size and distance. Philoponus acknowledges this difficulty, conceding that features implying size seem to be corporeal, which contradicts his idea of incorporeal actualities.\nPhysics of Deflection: Philoponus's incorporeal energeiai cannot be deflected by a mirror in the way a physical impulse could. To solve this, he and Alexander of Aphrodisias proposed that mirrors actively receive the energeiaiand then retransmit new ones. This is especially necessary to explain phenomena like burning glasses, where mirrors intensify light. However, this solution undermines a key aspect of Aristotle's view: that we see the object itself via deflection, not an observer-independent image in the mirror. If mirrors create new causal processes, then the resulting image becomes an independent effect, challenging Aristotle's account.\n\nThe \"It Makes No Difference\" Strategy\nBerryman suggests that the phrase \"it makes no difference\" (ouden diaphôrei) was used programmatically by commentators to assert the independence of geometrical optics from physical theories of vision. This \"insulation strategy\" became necessary as the mathematical sciences flourished and their findings grew increasingly at odds with Aristotelian natural philosophy. Philoponus explicitly links this idea to \"saving the appearances,\" a concept from astronomy, suggesting a parallel effort to manage conflicts between mathematical models and physical reality.\n\nThe article concludes that this tension was not unique to optics; similar conflicts existed in astronomy, harmonics, and mechanics. The strategy of insulating the intermediate sciences from natural philosophy was a response to the growing conceptual difficulties of creating a unified mathematical physics in late antiquity. This historical tension is a crucial factor in understanding the background to the emergence of a new, unified science in the 17th century.\n",

So while the literalists focuses on the material and efficient, Bolton claims these underdetermine the perception, and so require as well a further (formal and teleological) cause in order to count as full perceptions: “The matter or material cause of a thing, for Aristotle, is only what gives something the potential for being that thing (Phys II.1 193b6-8, DA II.2 414a25-7). More is required to guarantee the actuality of the thing” (216).&nbsp; [He hedges a bit about whether a formal cause without an efficient cause would be possible (spiritualism), but he thinks it would be possible only in weird cases, not as a general account.]</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">What is further required for the actuality of perception is the interaction with the the special sensibles and the intellect. We directly see the special sensibles, but this is only color; everything else requires some kind of inference (or awareness) by the mind: Aristotle’s “primary claim is that when I see a gold ring my senses are acted on by its gold color but not by its gold matter. So when I do see its gold matter this is not because I or my senses receive (the form of) its gold matter” (220). That is, when I detect the matter of the object by its color, I’m detecting an ‘incidental’ sensible by means of a ‘special’ sensible; or, put differently, the incidental sensible of detecting some conceptual property of the object (that Joe is Jim’s dad, or whatever).&nbsp; So for perception to be complete, it must involve material (the eye), efficient (some object being perceptible), formal (the sensory-properties themselves) and intellectual, as the awareness of the scene:</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">I do not necessarily perceive even the special or common sensibles that are acting on my perceptual system in normal conditions.&nbsp; Here again, then, even under normal conditions the external causal input taken alone can underdetermine the content of our perceptual states including all of our veridical perceptual states. 223</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">This means that the literalist reading greatly underdetermines what is required for perception: “We cannot see something, whether it be an eclipse or a color, without being aware that we are” (223). To put it in contemporary terms, we cannot see something without seeing that.&nbsp; So even though we directly see color, the rest of the world is detected by the ‘seeing that’ of the mind’s awareness. Bolton ties this together with the notion of phantasia, which Aristotle says we employ even when we are engaged in veridical perception: “this thesis, that phantasia occurs during even our veridical perception and is required for all of our perception, veridical and non-veridical, is in fact quite easy to understand,” because phantasia should just mean the appearances of objects (something like the propositional-conceptual synthesis of the sensibles into something we can use for thought) (230). So while “what I see is simply the external object,” Bolton claims that “what I see is determined by what visually appears to me though the visual appearance is not itself what I see” (236). So while perception is entirely passive, the object I see is determined by the phantasia I bring to bear to determine it.&nbsp;</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Bolton concludes, then, by trying to separate how his account is distinct from a sense-datum account. Specifically, he argues that for Aristotle we do not see phantasia, but simply see the sensible-properties themselves. It is only by means of the phantasia that we can make sense of the sensibles as an object (a seeing-that). So the phantasia do not generate a veil of perception.&nbsp; It might seem, though, that by requiring this cognitive level for even direct perception the account is de-naturalized. Bolton argues that current accounts that involve perception only at the material and efficient level have not convincingly solved the problem of underdetermination, so perhaps we should abandon the modern version of naturalism rather than abandon intentionality.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hot take: So, because we haven’t yet figured everything out using modern science, we should revert to ancient science?

He argues for this through several steps: First, he establishes that Aristotle treats psychology as natural science requiring all four causes (formal, material, efficient, final) to explain psychological states like perception. Second, he demonstrates that the efficient cause alone (external objects acting via special and common sensibles) underdetermines content—the same causal input can produce different perceptions depending on what the perceiver attends to. Third, he shows that the material cause consists of phantasia (internal sensory appearances with both material properties and intentional content) present in the sense organs during perception. Fourth, he argues that only the combination of appropriate efficient cause (external sensible qualities) and material cause (phantasmic appearances) under normal conditions sufficiently determines specific perceptual states and their content. This allows Aristotle to solve the underdetermination problem without reducing explanation to purely non-intentional material states, thus offering a distinctively viable form of naturalism where hylomorphic psychophysical entities can themselves serve as causes.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Bolton argues that Aristotle naturalizes perception: psychological states—including perception—belong to natural science and must be explained by integrating all four causes; in perception, the efficient cause supplied by the external sensibles underdetermines content, which is fixed only when paired with a material-causal contribution from phantasia, all within a direct-realist framework about the objects of perception. The argument runs as follows: (1) Programmatic premise: in De Anima I.1 Aristotle explicitly frames psychology as phusikē and requires that accounts of states like anger, desire, and perception mobilize formal, material, efficient, and final causes (402a–403b); this is the paper’s methodological anchor. (2) Anti-monocausal premise: Aristotle’s own examples (eclipse, sleep, anger) show that no single cause suffices; e.g., awareness of insult without the right bodily condition (or vice versa) does not amount to anger, so efficient- or material-only readings fail. (3) Perceptual efficient cause: Perception is caused by external objects (special/common sensibles), but in cases like “seeing a lunar eclipse” the efficient cause is restricted to patterns of color/light/shape; nonetheless that very same input could yield either mere patterns or “loss of light by the moon,” so causal input alone underdetermines content—even in veridical cases. (4) Material-causal completion: Aristotle assigns content determination to phantasia—a material change in the sense organs that “carries” appearance and directs awareness; when the appropriate sensibles (efficient cause) operate together with the relevant phantasmic state (material cause) under normal conditions, the underdetermination is removed.&nbsp;</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Bolton argues that Aristotle's theory of perception successfully resolves the problem of \"underdetermination\"—the fact that the external causal input (the efficient cause) is not sufficient to fix the specific content of a perceptual experience. Bolton's argument begins by establishing that Aristotle's \"naturalistic\" program requires an explanation of psychological states through all four of their causes, with no single cause being sufficient on its own. He then demonstrates that for perception, the efficient cause (the action of external objects on the sense organs) underdetermines the content, as the same external stimuli can result in different perceptual states depending on factors like attention or recognition. Bolton argues that Aristotle's solution is to introduce a specific material cause: an internal, psychophysical state called phantasia (appearance or sensory presentation). This phantasma, which is present in all perception, directs our perceptual awareness and gives the experience its specific content. Therefore, it is the combination of the external efficient cause and the internal material cause (phantasia) that sufficiently determines the content of perception, such as seeing a lunar eclipse rather than just patterns of light, thus completing Aristotle's naturalistic account.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span

This naturalism is defined by Aristotle's commitment to explaining psychological states through all four of their causes—formal, material, efficient, and final—all of which are essential to constitute the state in question. Bolton demonstrates that for Aristotle, no single cause is sufficient on its own to determine the presence or content of a psychological state like anger or perception. The article's main focus is to show how Aristotle's theory of perception solves the problem of \"underdetermination\"—the fact that the external causal input (the efficient cause) is not enough to fix the content of a perceptual experience. Bolton's central thesis is that Aristotle resolves this underdetermination by combining the efficient cause with a specific material cause: an internal, psychophysical state called phantasia, or appearance.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Aristotle’s Naturalistic Program</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Bolton begins by establishing that Aristotle’s objective in De Anima is to conduct a genuine natural science of the soul, one that requires an understanding of all four causes for any psychological state.

Similarly, the awareness of an insult might not produce anger if the body is not in the right state.

They are the sensory appearances (e.g., the \"look\" of something) that are required for perception to occur. These appearances persist even after the external object is gone, as in the case of afterimages.</span></p></li><li dir=\"ltr\" style=\"list-style-type:disc;font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;\" aria-level=\"1\"><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" role=\"presentation\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fixing perceptual content: The phantasma is not what we directly perceive (in normal vision, the object of perception is the external thing itself), but it is what directs our perceptual awareness and gives our experience its specific content.

So while the literalists focuses on the material and efficient, Bolton claims these underdetermine the perception, and so require as well a further (formal and teleological) cause in order to count as full perceptions: “The matter or material cause of a thing, for Aristotle, is only what gives something the potential for being that thing (Phys II.1 193b6-8, DA II.2 414a25-7). More is required to guarantee the actuality of the thing” (216).&nbsp; [He hedges a bit about whether a formal cause without an efficient cause would be possible (spiritualism), but he thinks it would be possible only in weird cases, not as a general account.]</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">What is further required for the actuality of perception is the interaction with the the special sensibles and the intellect. We directly see the special sensibles, but this is only color; everything else requires some kind of inference (or awareness) by the mind: Aristotle’s “primary claim is that when I see a gold ring my senses are acted on by its gold color but not by its gold matter. So when I do see its gold matter this is not because I or my senses receive (the form of) its gold matter” (220). That is, when I detect the matter of the object by its color, I’m detecting an ‘incidental’ sensible by means of a ‘special’ sensible; or, put differently, the incidental sensible of detecting some conceptual property of the object (that Joe is Jim’s dad, or whatever).&nbsp; So for perception to be complete, it must involve material (the eye), efficient (some object being perceptible), formal (the sensory-properties themselves) and intellectual, as the awareness of the scene:</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">I do not necessarily perceive even the special or common sensibles that are acting on my perceptual system in normal conditions.&nbsp; Here again, then, even under normal conditions the external causal input taken alone can underdetermine the content of our perceptual states including all of our veridical perceptual states. 223</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">This means that the literalist reading greatly underdetermines what is required for perception: “We cannot see something, whether it be an eclipse or a color, without being aware that we are” (223). To put it in contemporary terms, we cannot see something without seeing that.&nbsp; So even though we directly see color, the rest of the world is detected by the ‘seeing that’ of the mind’s awareness. Bolton ties this together with the notion of phantasia, which Aristotle says we employ even when we are engaged in veridical perception: “this thesis, that phantasia occurs during even our veridical perception and is required for all of our perception, veridical and non-veridical, is in fact quite easy to understand,” because phantasia should just mean the appearances of objects (something like the propositional-conceptual synthesis of the sensibles into something we can use for thought) (230). So while “what I see is simply the external object,” Bolton claims that “what I see is determined by what visually appears to me though the visual appearance is not itself what I see” (236). So while perception is entirely passive, the object I see is determined by the phantasia I bring to bear to determine it.&nbsp;</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Bolton concludes, then, by trying to separate how his account is distinct from a sense-datum account. Specifically, he argues that for Aristotle we do not see phantasia, but simply see the sensible-properties themselves. It is only by means of the phantasia that we can make sense of the sensibles as an object (a seeing-that). So the phantasia do not generate a veil of perception.&nbsp; It might seem, though, that by requiring this cognitive level for even direct perception the account is de-naturalized. Bolton argues that current accounts that involve perception only at the material and efficient level have not convincingly solved the problem of underdetermination, so perhaps we should abandon the modern version of naturalism rather than abandon intentionality.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Hot take: So, because we haven’t yet figured everything out using modern science, we should revert to ancient science?

He argues for this through several steps: First, he establishes that Aristotle treats psychology as natural science requiring all four causes (formal, material, efficient, final) to explain psychological states like perception. Second, he demonstrates that the efficient cause alone (external objects acting via special and common sensibles) underdetermines content—the same causal input can produce different perceptions depending on what the perceiver attends to. Third, he shows that the material cause consists of phantasia (internal sensory appearances with both material properties and intentional content) present in the sense organs during perception. Fourth, he argues that only the combination of appropriate efficient cause (external sensible qualities) and material cause (phantasmic appearances) under normal conditions sufficiently determines specific perceptual states and their content. This allows Aristotle to solve the underdetermination problem without reducing explanation to purely non-intentional material states, thus offering a distinctively viable form of naturalism where hylomorphic psychophysical entities can themselves serve as causes.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Bolton argues that Aristotle naturalizes perception: psychological states—including perception—belong to natural science and must be explained by integrating all four causes; in perception, the efficient cause supplied by the external sensibles underdetermines content, which is fixed only when paired with a material-causal contribution from phantasia, all within a direct-realist framework about the objects of perception. The argument runs as follows: (1) Programmatic premise: in De Anima I.1 Aristotle explicitly frames psychology as phusikē and requires that accounts of states like anger, desire, and perception mobilize formal, material, efficient, and final causes (402a–403b); this is the paper’s methodological anchor. (2) Anti-monocausal premise: Aristotle’s own examples (eclipse, sleep, anger) show that no single cause suffices; e.g., awareness of insult without the right bodily condition (or vice versa) does not amount to anger, so efficient- or material-only readings fail. (3) Perceptual efficient cause: Perception is caused by external objects (special/common sensibles), but in cases like “seeing a lunar eclipse” the efficient cause is restricted to patterns of color/light/shape; nonetheless that very same input could yield either mere patterns or “loss of light by the moon,” so causal input alone underdetermines content—even in veridical cases. (4) Material-causal completion: Aristotle assigns content determination to phantasia—a material change in the sense organs that “carries” appearance and directs awareness; when the appropriate sensibles (efficient cause) operate together with the relevant phantasmic state (material cause) under normal conditions, the underdetermination is removed.&nbsp;</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Bolton argues that Aristotle's theory of perception successfully resolves the problem of \"underdetermination\"—the fact that the external causal input (the efficient cause) is not sufficient to fix the specific content of a perceptual experience. Bolton's argument begins by establishing that Aristotle's \"naturalistic\" program requires an explanation of psychological states through all four of their causes, with no single cause being sufficient on its own. He then demonstrates that for perception, the efficient cause (the action of external objects on the sense organs) underdetermines the content, as the same external stimuli can result in different perceptual states depending on factors like attention or recognition. Bolton argues that Aristotle's solution is to introduce a specific material cause: an internal, psychophysical state called phantasia (appearance or sensory presentation). This phantasma, which is present in all perception, directs our perceptual awareness and gives the experience its specific content. Therefore, it is the combination of the external efficient cause and the internal material cause (phantasia) that sufficiently determines the content of perception, such as seeing a lunar eclipse rather than just patterns of light, thus completing Aristotle's naturalistic account.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span

This naturalism is defined by Aristotle's commitment to explaining psychological states through all four of their causes—formal, material, efficient, and final—all of which are essential to constitute the state in question. Bolton demonstrates that for Aristotle, no single cause is sufficient on its own to determine the presence or content of a psychological state like anger or perception. The article's main focus is to show how Aristotle's theory of perception solves the problem of \"underdetermination\"—the fact that the external causal input (the efficient cause) is not enough to fix the content of a perceptual experience. Bolton's central thesis is that Aristotle resolves this underdetermination by combining the efficient cause with a specific material cause: an internal, psychophysical state called phantasia, or appearance.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Aristotle’s Naturalistic Program</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:12pt;font-family:'Times New Roman',serif;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">Bolton begins by establishing that Aristotle’s objective in De Anima is to conduct a genuine natural science of the soul, one that requires an understanding of all four causes for any psychological state.

By requiring both an external causal trigger and an internal, content-bearing material state (phantasia), Aristotle accounts for how perceptual content is fixed without making the internal state the direct object of perception, thus preserving a direct realist account of vision.</span></p>"
